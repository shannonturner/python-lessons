# Example Question: How could you "slice" the dictionary to print "Feature" from line 15?
# Answer: print schools["type"]

# Question 1: What slice will give you a dictionary 
#   with the key of "coordinates" and a value containing a list
#   with the items -81.50572799999999 and 39.21675500000001?

# Question 2: What slice will give you the address of the school?

# Question 3: What slice will give you the name of the school?

# Question 4: What slice will give you the latitude of the school? 
#   (Hint: the latitude is 39.216...)

# Question 5 (bonus): What slice will give you the marker-color 
#   without the hashtag in front?
