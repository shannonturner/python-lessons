# Basic Syntax

# This is a comment.
# That means Python will let you write notes to yourself and to the other coders checking out your code
# And Python won't run this at all, or even notice it.

# The # symbol is what creates a comment.
# You can have a comment on a line all by itself

# The print statement is a good place to start -- it allows us to see results right away.

print "Or you can have a comment on the same line" # as a command that Python WILL run

print "The print statement will output some text to the screen." # it doesn't print anything to paper.

# Python will run commands from top to bottom, left to right

# So the print statement on line 11 will run before the print statement on line 13




print "You can use lots of newlines to space things out if you like"
print "Or you can keep your statements close to one another."

print "It's really up to you, but generally speaking, you'll want to make your code as readable as possible."

# These two statements are identical
print 4+4
print 4 + 4

# Indentation levels matter a lot, even if other kinds of whitespace like newlines or spacing don't matter as much

# So if you uncommented the next line and ran this, you'd get an error.
#    print 4 + 4
