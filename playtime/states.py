# Goal: Create a program that prints out an HTML drop down menu for all 50 states

# Step 1: Define your list of states
# These should all be strings, since they're names of places
# Instead of having to type them all out, I really like liststates.com -- you can even customize the format it gives you the states in to make it super easy to copy/paste into your code here

# Step 2: Create your loop
# Essentially, you're telling Python: for each state in my list: print this HTML code
# A good place to start is by printing the name of the state in the loop; after that you can add the HTML around it

# Step 3: Add the HTML
# A drop-down menu in HTML looks like this:

# <select>
# 			<option value="state_abbreviation">Full state name</option>
# </select>

# At line 14, we create the drop-down menu
# At line 15, we create one drop-down item.  Each additional <option> that we add will add another item to our drop-down menu
# At line 16, we tell HTML that we're done with the drop-down menu

# Step 4: Test it!
# Have Python print out the HTML code. Copy / paste it into a file, save that file as "states.html" and open that file in a web browser.
# Later, when we learn file handling, we can skip the copy/paste step.
# File handling can also let us create a file with the state names and abbreviations in it so we don't have to add it to our code.

# Your finished project should look something like: https://github.com/shannonturner/python-lessons/blob/master/section_05_(loops)/states.html
