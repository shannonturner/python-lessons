# Difficulty Level: Beginner
# Exercise: Tweet length calculator

# Part one:
# Create a variable called tweet and put some text in it
#   maybe something like "Hear Me Code class was so much fun today!"

# Measure the length of that tweet.

# Was that tweet more than 140 characters?
#   If so, tell the user it was too long!
# Was that tweet 140 or fewer characters?
#   If so, tell the user how witty they are!


# Part two:
# Adjust the program to say how many characters you have remaining to use, or how many you need to trim by in order to meet the 140 character limit


# Part three:
# Twitter announced they are changing their character limit to 280, but they might change it again.
# Can you make your code flexible enough so that you don't have to replace the character limit in multiple places in your code?
