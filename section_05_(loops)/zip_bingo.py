# Normal for loops allow you to loop over a list and do something for each item in that list.
# A for loop using zip() allows you to loop over multiple lists and do something with each item in those lists at the same time.
# Normally, you'll want to do that with lists that are the same size.  But it still works if one list is shorter; it just behaves a little differently.

# In this case, words is 26 items long and range(25) is 25 items long
# So the for loop will only run 25 times in this case.

# No matter how many more items you add to words, your bingo board should only have 25 squares.

# If you uncomment lines #19 and #20, you'll get a random bingo board every time you run!
# import random
# random.shuffle(words)
